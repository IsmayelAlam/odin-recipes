        <p><em>This grilled beef tenderloin is seasoned with rosemary, thyme, and garlic, then grilled to a rosy pink.</em></p>
        
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (5 pound) whole beef tenderloin</li>
            <li>8 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a sharp knife or scissors to remove silverskin and trim excess fat from tenderloin. <br>
                Fold the thinner end under to approximate the thickness of the rest of the roast and tie with butcher's twine to secure. <br>
                Tie tenderloin in 1 1/2- to 2-inch intervals to help it keep its shape during cooking.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix together garlic, oil, rosemary, pepper, thyme, and salt in a small bowl; rub over tenderloin to coat. Let sit while you preheat the grill.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Light a charcoal fire in one half of a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill to high for 10 minutes and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Place tenderloin on the hot grill and close the lid. Grill until well-seared, about 5 minutes. Flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Move tenderloin to the cool side of the charcoal grill, or if using a gas grill, turn off the burner directly underneath the tenderloin and <br>
                turn the remaining one or two burners (depending on grill style) to medium. Cook until rosy pink and a meat thermometer inserted in the <br>
                thickest section registers 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), 45 to 60 minutes. Cook time will depend on tenderloin size and grill.Move tenderloin <br>
