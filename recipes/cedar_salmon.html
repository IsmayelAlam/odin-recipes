    <p><em>This cedar-plank salmon is a dish my brother prepared for me in Seattle. It is by far the best salmon I've ever eaten.<br> 
        I like to serve it with an Asian-inspired rice and roasted asparagus.</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>3 (12 inch) untreated cedar planks </li>
    <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped green onions</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 (2 pound) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>step 01</li>
        Soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour in warm water. Soak longer if you have time.
        <li>step 02</li>
        Stir together soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic in a shallow dish.
        <li>step 03</li>
        Place salmon fillets in soy mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 1 hour refrigerated.
        <li>step 04</li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place planks on the grill grate. Heat planks until they start to smoke and crackle just a little.
        <li>step 05</li>
        Remove salmon from marinade and place on planks; discard marinade.
        <li>step 06</li>
        Close grill cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes; salmon will continue to cook after you remove it from the grill.
        
    </ul>
